## Enterprise Data. AIâ€‘Ready.

Enterprise data remains inherently messy. It is created in one silo, copied into others, combined, moved, and referenced repeatedly. Each fragment leaves behind a trail of breadcrumbsâ€”a lineage of where it came from and how it has been used. Caber makes that lineage visible, at scale, across documents, databases, emails, and workflows.

> **ðŸš€ New!** Explore our [PDF vs. HTML Parsing Benchmark Repo](https://github.com/Caber-Systems/pdf-vs-html-parser) and the [accompanying blog post]([https://caber.com/blog/pdf-vs-html-parse-times](https://www.caber.com/blog/2e0a903d-caa2-4e93-a3a6-94636ec5ee2e)) where we measured how long different parsers take to process enterprise documents.

## Why Caber Stands Out

* **Scalable Architecture:** Caber traces data relationships and builds its knowledge graph with optimized algorithms written in C, C++, and Rust, then uses AI for analysis of the results.
* **Cross-System Relationships:** While many tools focus on file-level events or sections within one document, Caber traces data fragments across multiple systems of record, showing how information truly flows.
* **Deterministic Lineage:** Instead of probabilistic guesses, Caber deterministically follows sentences, paragraphs, and table cells back to their sources, allowing teams to know exactly what data they are working with.
* **Policy-Ready Metadata:** By understanding precise origins, Caber can help organizations automatically apply usage policies and surface data quality issues that otherwise stay hidden.

## Practical Use Cases

* **Data Preparation for AI:** Select only the right data for training and retrievalâ€‘augmented generation (RAG), reducing noise and improving model accuracy.
* **RAG Metadata Enrichment:** Caber enriches chunks with true origin and business context as they are retreived from vector RAG databases to improve AI answer quality.
* **GraphRag Construction:** Use Caber to build the data relationships for GraphRag deterministically without LLMs.
* **Permissions-based Data Access:** Caber labels data with the business context so you can filter what data is used based on your business logic.
* **Compliance Evidence:** Generate accurate lineage reports that stand up in audits because they are backed by concrete data movement records.


## A Tool Built for Builders

Caber was designed with engineers, data architects, and security teams in mind. It integrates with existing data pipelines, surfaces verifiable lineage, and gives you tools to reason about your dataâ€™s journey across the enterprise.
